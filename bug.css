The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with custom directives or plugins.  If the custom directive or plugin modifies the styles of an element, and the `@apply` directive is used on that element, the styles might conflict or be applied incorrectly.  This can result in unexpected or missing styles. For example, if a plugin adds a `bg-red-500` class to every element with the class `container`, and then you apply another background class using `@apply bg-blue-500` to a container element, the order of application could impact the final color.
